# Naive-Bayes-Classification-from-Scratch
Naive Bayes is a statistical classification technique based on Bayes Theorem. It is one of the simplest supervised learning algorithms. 

> Naive Bayes classifiers have high accuracy and speed on large datasets.

It is not a single algorithm but a family of algorithms where all of them shares a common principle, i.e **every pair of features being classified is independent of each other.**
