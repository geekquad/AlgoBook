## Description
The notebook contains a neural network model which is built from scratch. It has all functions for the equations of a Neural Network. No external Library is used except Numpy for matrices and matplotlib for visualization.  

The hyperparametrs of the model are not tuned and regularization is not added to equations, so the model currently overfits, but these things will be updated shortly.  
  
The main purpose of this script is the understand the mathematics behind the equations of neural network(backpropagation, feed forward , activations etc.) Every function is implemented from scratch.
