# Linked List
A linked list is a sequence of data elements, which are connected together via links. Each data element contains a connection to another data element in form of a pointer. Python does not have linked lists in its standard library. We implement the concept of linked lists using the concept of nodes as discussed.
There are three common types of Linked List.

# Singly Linked List :-
It is the most common. Each node has data and a pointer to the next node.

# Doubly Linked List :-
We add a pointer to the previous node in a doubly-linked list. Thus, we can go in either direction: forward or backward.
We can also reverse the doubly linked list

# Circular Linked List :-
A circular linked list is a variation of a linked list in which the last element is linked to the first element. This forms a circular loop.

A circular linked list can be either singly linked or doubly linked.

for singly linked list, next pointer of last item points to the first item
In the doubly linked list, prev pointer of the first item points to the last item as well.
